Game starts explaining the world of magic and ask’s the player questions that will assign specific stats and a element matching who they are

if someone is protective or caring it will assign them high health but lower attack and life/earth element

Agressive people get assigned fire with high attack power but lower life

Relaxed people get water with balanced stats

And element matters
Fire beats life
Water beats fire
Life beats water

You get a spell book containing prob 6 spells and when you use a spell it fades away. After two victories againsts monsters you can regain a spell of your choice. But gotta use them wisely


Goal of game: learn all three elements becoming the strongest wizard

Boss: all the boss battles are powerful wizards using a certain element

After 3 fights player choose a direction. Left or right. This will decide what element the boss battle will be(can’t be the same as player). If player wins battle the player gets spell book for that boss element. Then continues after 3 battles the final boss will appear (wizards element is whichever element the player doesn’t have). If the player wins they will have acquired all magic elements ending the game telling them they won and something like they are the strongest wizard now or something. (Final boss needs powerful stats bc the player will already have the advantage element).
